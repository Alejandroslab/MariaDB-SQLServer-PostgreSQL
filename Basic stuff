in this not necessary to write commands in capital letters

Before starting you need to SPEFICY WHICH DATABSE YOU WANT TO USE:
with this command:

USE mydatabase

When you select a database to be used you will see
that is empty if it hase been just created.
therefore you need to create tables to populate it.

you can create table:

CREATE TABLE mytable (
-> id PRIMARY KEY INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT
-> name VARCHAR(5)
-> mobile VARCHAR(20)
-> );

use show tables to show the tables:

SHOW TABLES

to see the structure of a table you use the command DESCRIBE

DESCRIBE mytable;
you will get the names and characteristics of each field in
the tables

you can get the same with SHOW COLUMNS:

SHOW COLUMNS FROM mytable;
