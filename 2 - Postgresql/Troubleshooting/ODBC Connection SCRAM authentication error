ERROR ON WINDOWS:

In this case you will need to change your password encryption from sha-256 to md5

to do that change 'password_encryption' in the file 'postgresql.conf' inside
C:/Programs/PostreSQL/14/data
you must also uncomment removing the '#' symbol

you must also change the 'sha-256' inside the file 'pg_hba'

Now you have to restart postgres. To do that the fastest way is to go to:
 'Services.msc' and look for and restart the postgresql server

(The other way implicates to cd to /data folder again within cmd and to run the command 'pg_ctl' and restart..)




Now you need to change your password in order to get the new (lower) encryption

To do that open 'cmd':

Then change directory to :

C:\Program Files\PostreSQL\14\bin

run this command to access with your user (in this case the user is called 'postgres'):

psql -U postgres

now type your current password

ok. now you are inside your user. the cmd line will change to 'postgres-#'
to change the password there are different ways:
The solution that worked (probably because cmd was not running as Administrator)
was to type:

/password

now postrgesql wil ask for the new password and to confirm it

after that your password is definitely changed.

(The other solution was to use a command like:

ALTER USER myuser WITH PASSWORD 'mynewpassword';

but this did not work out)
