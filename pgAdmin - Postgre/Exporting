You will use COPY but instead of 'FROM' you will be using 'TO':

COPY mytable
TO 'C:\Your Directory\mytable.txt'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER, DELIMITER '|');

EXPORTING ONLY SOME COLUMNS:


COPY mytable (column1, column3)
TO 'C:\Your Directory\mytable.txt'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER, DELIMITER '|');


EXPORTING QUERY result

COPY (
SELECT column1, column3
FROM mytable
WHERE column1 ILIKE '%red%'
)
TO 'C:\Your Directory\mytable.txt'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER, DELIMITER '|');

REMEMBER! this commands will not work if your postgre instance is located on another computer, elsewhere on a network
You can solve this problem just using the import export wizard (right click on your table)
