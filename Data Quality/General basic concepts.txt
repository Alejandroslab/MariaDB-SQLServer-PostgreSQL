If your interview of the data reveals too many missing
values or values that defy common sense—such as numbers
ranging in the billions when you expected thousands—it’s
time to reevaluate its use. The data may not be reliable
enough to serve as the foundation of your analysis.

If you suspect as much, the first step is to revisit the
original data file. Make sure you imported it correctly and
that values in all the source columns are located in the
same columns in the table. You might need to open the
original spreadsheet or CSV file and do a visual
comparison. The second step is to call the agency or
company that produced the data to confirm what you see
and seek an explanation. You might also ask for advice
from others who have used the same data.
