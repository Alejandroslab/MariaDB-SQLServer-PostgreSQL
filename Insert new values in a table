INSERT INTO Employees
(ID. Nome. Surname. Address. Wage. Department)
VALUES(20. 'Mark'. 'Ross'. 'New York'. 100000. 'Accounting')

to update a value such as the ID of a record just use:

UPDATE Employees
SET Department = 'Back Office'
WHERE ID = 20;

to delete the data of a record with ID 20

WHERE Department = 'Back Office';
