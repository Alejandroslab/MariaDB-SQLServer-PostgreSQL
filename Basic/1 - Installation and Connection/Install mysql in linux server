sudo apt-get install mysql-server

After the installation you can check the status:

 systemctl status mysql


After running the process you have to create a new user

sudo mysql

 CREATE USER 'myuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';
 
 (remember that all the commands in mysql ends with ';' symbol)

in this syntax you will see within marks the name of the user.
The % indicates all the hosts could access wth those credentials (otherwise that woul de the IP address or the hostname)

Now assign privileges:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'myuser  '@'%';




--
show all users:

first, quit mysql. Then:
sudo mysql -u root -p

mysql> use mysql;

Now this command will produce a table with the list of all the users:

mysql> SELECT user FROM user;
