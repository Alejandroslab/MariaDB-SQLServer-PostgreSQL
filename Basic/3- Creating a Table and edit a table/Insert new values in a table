INSERT INTO Employees
(ID, Name, Surname, Address, Wage, Department)
VALUES(20, 'Mark', 'Ross', 'New York', 100000, 'Accounting')

to update a value such as the ID of a record just use:

UPDATE Employees
SET Department = 'Back Office'
WHERE ID = 20;

to delete the data of a record with ID 20

DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE ID = 20;

let's increase the wage of all the employees of the Back Office department:

UPDATE Employees
SET Wage = Wage * 1.05
WHERE Department = 'Back Office';

to delete the records of the R&D employees:

DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'R&S'
