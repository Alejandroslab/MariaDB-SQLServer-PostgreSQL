FIRST: It is not necessary to write commands in capital letters
(but you must use them when using the datbases or tables as sql is case sensitive)
Remember also to end every command with the symbol ';'



SQL works with databases and tables.
Databases contain tables.


Before starting manipulating tables you need to SPEFICY WHICH DATABSE YOU WANT TO USE:
To do that you must use this command:


USE mydatabase;


When you select a database to be used you will see
that is empty if it hase been just created.
therefore you need to create tables to populate it.


REMEMBER: you cannot "undo" the USE command. this means that you have to quit mysql in order to use another database


After launhcin USE mydatabase you can use show tables to show the tables:

SHOW TABLES;



to see the structure of a table you use the command DESCRIBE

DESCRIBE mytable;
you will get the names and characteristics of each field in
the tables

you can get the same with SHOW COLUMNS:

SHOW COLUMNS FROM mytable;
