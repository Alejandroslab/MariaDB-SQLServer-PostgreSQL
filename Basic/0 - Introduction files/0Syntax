First: always remember to end every line with the semicolon ';'

Second: be carefol to quotes!

this is very insidious:

the quotes always must be single quotes like '' not smart quotes like ‘ ’

the difference stands in the little inclination towards right of the smart quotes.



then:

remember to use capital letters for commands like:

SELECT, SHOW, etc
