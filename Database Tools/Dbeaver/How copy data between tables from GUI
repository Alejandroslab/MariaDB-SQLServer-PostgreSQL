You can move columns and then copy with ctrl+c

to paste to a new table just create first a new row then click right and select 'paste advanced' leave checked 'insert multiple rows' and click ok

if you have a lot of rows to copy it will take some time

if you are satisfied finally click on save
CAREFUL
YOU CANNOT UNDO changes if you have not set up the commit mode
anyways you can delete the added rows
