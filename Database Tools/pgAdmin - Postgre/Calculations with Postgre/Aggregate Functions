SELECT sum(column1) AS "sum of the column",
round(avg(column1),0) AS "average of the column"
FROM mytable


for the median you have to use percentile function that are:
percentile_cont(n) for continous values
and
percentile_disc(n) for discrete values

you will usually use percentile_cont(n) for continous values

SELECT percentile_cont(.5)
WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY column1)
FROM mytable;
