when importing the delimiter is usually the comma (although you can change it)

REMMEBER! that if you use a double quote " " then the import function will ignore the delimiters inside the double quoted colum!

e.g.

Maria, Rossi, "20100, Milano", Italia

In this case the comma inside the double quote "20100, Milano" will be ignored
