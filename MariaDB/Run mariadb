You can run mariadb with the same command that you use for mysql that is:

sudo mysql

the difference is that when you type in your password you will get the welcome message
that is different

you will get:

'Welcome to the MariaDB monitor'....
in case of a MariaDB instance otherwise you will get:

'Welcome to the MySQL monitor' in case of a mysql installation

the syntax is anyways almost identical
