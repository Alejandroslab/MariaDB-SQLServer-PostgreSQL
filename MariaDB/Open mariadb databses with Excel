The procedure is similar to the mysql one

Basically you have to download the MariaDB connector driver
Then add a DSN with ODBC Source that you find in WINDOWS (you can add a system one if you need that the
access will be available to every user)
Click on add
select MariaDB ODBC driver
Type a name for the connection

Specify the server name and the port (3306)
then the username and the password


Once you have done click on next, next and then finish

Now you can open Excel
Data>Get Data>From Other Sources>From ODBC

Now select your last saved server
and click connect!
DONE
