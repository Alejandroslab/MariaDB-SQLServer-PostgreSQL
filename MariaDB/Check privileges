To check privileges just use:


SHOW GRANTS;

to get the list of all PRIVILEGES


otherwise:

SHOW GRANTS FOR 'myusername'@localhost;

to check the grants for the user myusername

remember if you check
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'myusername';
then you will get nothing as you are not specifying the host in which looking for that username
