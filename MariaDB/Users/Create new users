Create a new user on MariaDB

Here is how to do this

    Connect to the MySQL command line:
    sudo mysql -uroot -p
    Create a new database:
    CREATE DATABASE <dbname>;

    In this step and the following, replace all variables between <…> by the name you want to use
    Now, create the new user:

    CREATE USER '<username>'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';

    Then, allow this new user to do anything on the database we just created:

    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <dbname>.* TO '<username>'@'localhost';

    Finally, reload the permissions with:
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

    You can now check that everything works fine with:
sudo mysql -u<username> -p

And use the password you just created

You can do most of the MySQL configuration in the command line, but it’s not always easy if you don’t know the MySQL language
So, I’ll show you here two ways to configure your server
/etc/mysql


NOW REMEMEBER THAT IF YOU WANT TO HAVE ACCESS FROM OUTSIDE YOUR SERVER YOU NEED TO CHANGE the 'localhost' part to the '%' part:


 CREATE USER 'myuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';


 remember to use always the '' symbols

The % indicates all the hosts could access with those credentials (otherwise that would be the IP address or the hostname)
If you type in just 'localhost' you will only be able to connect from your server

Now assign privileges:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'myuser'@'%';

REMEMBERA ALSO TO FLUSH:

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
you may finally need to restart the mysql/mariadb service on your server
