Create a new user on MariaDB

Here is how to do this

    Connect to the MySQL command line:
    sudo mysql -uroot -p
    Create a new database:
    CREATE DATABASE <dbname>;

    In this step and the following, replace all variables between <…> by the name you want to use
    Now, create the new user:
    CREATE USER '<username>'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
    Then, allow this new user to do anything on the database we just created:
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <dbname>.* TO '<username>'@'localhost';
    Finally, reload the permissions with:
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

    You can now check that everything works fine with:
sudo mysql -u<username> -p

And use the password you just created

You can do most of the MySQL configuration in the command line, but it’s not always easy if you don’t know the MySQL language
So, I’ll show you here two ways to configure your server
/etc/mysql
