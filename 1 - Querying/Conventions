Microsoft recommends Pascal case
for its SQL Server users. Whichever convention you prefer, it’s most
important to choose a style and apply it consistently. Be sure to check
whether your organization has a style guide or offer to collaborate on
one, and then follow it religiously.

Use snake case. Snake case is readable and reliable, as shown in the
earlier trees_planted example. It’s used throughout the official
PostgreSQL documentation and helps make multiword names easy
to understand: video_on_demand makes more sense at a glance than
videoondemand.

Make names easy to understand and avoid cryptic
abbreviations. If you’re building a database related to travel,
arrival_time is a better reminder of the content as a column name than
arv_tm.

For table names, use plurals. Tables hold rows, and each row
represents one instance of an entity. So, use plural names for tables,
such as teachers, vehicles, or departments.
Mind the length. The maximum number of characters allowed for
an identifier name varies by database application: the SQL standard
is 128 characters, but PostgreSQL limits you to 63, and the Oracle
system maximum is 30. If you’re writing code that may get reused in
another database system, lean toward shorter identifier names.
When making copies of tables, use names that will help you
manage them later. One method is to append a YYYY_MM_DD date to
the table name when you create it, such as tire_sizes_2017_10_20. An
additional benefit is that the table names will sort in date order.
