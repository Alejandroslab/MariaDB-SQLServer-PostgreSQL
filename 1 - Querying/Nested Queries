You can use SELECT instead of a WHERE clause

SELECT Last_Name, First_Name
FROM Employees
WHERE ID =
(
  SELECT Manager
  FROM Department
  WHERE Code =
  (
    SELECT Department
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Last_Name = 'Ross' AND First_Name = 'Mark'
  )
);

this will retrieve the name of the manager of Mark Ross employee

Another example:
SELECT Last_Name, First_Name
FROM Employees
WHERE Wage < (SELECT AVG(Wage) FROM Employees);

in this case you have to use nested queires as the aggregate functions
could appear in the clause SELECT and HAVING but not in the WHERE clause
