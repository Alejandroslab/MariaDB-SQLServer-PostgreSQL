   To get all the cities per employee without duplicates just use DISTINCT

SELECT DISTINCT City
FROM Employees;

without DISTINCT you will get city duplicates based on the total number of the records
that in this case corresponds to the table Employees


SELECT DISTINCT mycolumn FROM mytable;

it will retrieve only unique values from the column mycolumn
Good for assessing data quality

It works also in more than one column
