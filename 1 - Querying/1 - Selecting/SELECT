SELECT * FROM tablename WHERE condition


SELECT Last Name, First Name, City
FROM Employees
Where Department = 'R&D'


SELECT Last Name, First Name, City
FROM Employees
Where Department = 'R&D' AND City = 'London';

To get all the cities per employee without duplicates just use DISTINCT

SELECT DISTINCT City
FROM Employees;

without DISTINCT you will get city duplicates based on the total number of the records
that in this case corresponds to the table Employees
