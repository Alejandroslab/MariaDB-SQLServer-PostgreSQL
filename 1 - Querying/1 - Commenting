Comment with: --


SELECT * FROM TABLE
--THIS IS A COMMENT

You can also place a multiline comment.

SELECT * FROM TABLE
/* This is a multiline
comment
*/


Finally you can also set a comment in the middle of the code:

SELECT * FROM TABLE
WHERE NAME= 'MIKE' /* AND SURNAME = 'ROSS' */

Doing this the part "AND SURNAME = 'ROSS' " will not be considered!
