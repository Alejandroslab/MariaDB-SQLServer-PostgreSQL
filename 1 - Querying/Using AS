If you want to rename a column when querying use AS
SELECT ID AS IDNumber, First Name, Last Name
FROM Employees;

If you want to add a sort of temporary column in which you process some info use
also AS

SELECT LAST_NAME, FIRST_NAME, Wage AS CurrentWage, Wage*1.05 AS NewWage
FROM Employees;


you can use also:

SELECT Last Name, First Name, City
FROM Employees
WHERE Wage >= 55000
