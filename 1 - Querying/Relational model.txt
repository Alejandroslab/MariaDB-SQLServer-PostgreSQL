Part of the science (or art, some may say) of joining tables involves
understanding how the database designer intends for the tables to relate,
also known as the database’s relational model. The three types of table
relationships are one to one, one to many, and many to many.

In a one-to-many relationship, a key value in the first table will have
multiple matching values in the second table’s joined column. Consider a
database that tracks automobiles. One table would hold data on
automobile manufacturers, with one row each for Ford, Honda, Kia, and
so on. A second table with model names, such as Focus, Civic, Sedona,
and Accord, would have several rows matching each row in the
manufacturers’ table.

In a many-to-many relationship, multiple rows in the first table will have
multiple matching rows in the second table. As an example, a table of
baseball players could be joined to a table of field positions. Each player
can be assigned to multiple positions, and each position can be played by
multiple people.
Understanding these relationships is essential because it helps us
discern whether the results of queries accurately reflect the structure of
the database.
