If you want to create a user that can be used from a remote machine (that is not 'localhost')

Then you have to set it up with the '%' symbol when you create it 

CREATE USER 'test'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'newpassword';

IN THIS PARTCULAR CASE YOU CAN ALSO OMIT THE '%' SYMBOL AND YOU WILL GET THE SAME RESULT 
(you can check it listing the users with:

SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;
)

therefore you can type:

CREATE USER 'test' IDENTIFIED BY 'newpassword';



Next, you need to flush the privileges, which reloads the user table in MySQL. You must perform this step each time you add or edit a user.

The following example shows the command that you use to flush privileges:

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


At this stage, your new user (test) has no permissions set and canâ€™t do anything.
You might want to start setting permissions by assigning SELECT (read-only) permissions
on all of the available databases.
You can grant select permissions by running the following command:

GRANT SELECT ON * . * TO 'test'@'%';


if you want just to grant privilges to some databases:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `mytestdb` . * TO 'test'@'%';

all privileges to the user:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'test'@'%';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
