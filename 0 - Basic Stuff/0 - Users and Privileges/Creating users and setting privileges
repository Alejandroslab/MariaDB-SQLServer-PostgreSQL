CREATE USER 'test'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'newpassword';

Next, you need to flush the privileges, which reloads the user table in MySQL. You must perform this step each time you add or edit a user.

The following example shows the command that you use to flush privileges:

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


At this stage, your new user (test) has no permissions set and canâ€™t do anything.
You might want to start setting permissions by assigning SELECT (read-only) permissions
on all of the available databases.

REMEMBER ALL THIS COMMANDS MUST BE RUN BY ROOT

sudo mysql -u root -p


You can grant just 'SELECT' permissions by running the following command:


GRANT SELECT ON * . * TO 'test'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

if you want just to grant privilges to some databases:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `mytestdb` . * TO 'test'@'localhost';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


If you want to grant all privileges on all just run:


GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'test'@'localhost';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

If you want to grant privileges on all interfaces isntead of 'localhost' use '%'

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'test'@'%';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;



to check that the user 'test' has only read-only privileges

log in as the user 'test' and try to create a database

mysql -u test -p


CREATE DATABASE mytestdb2;

you will get this error:

ERROR 1044 (42000): Access denied for user 'test'@'localhost' to database 'mytestdb2'
