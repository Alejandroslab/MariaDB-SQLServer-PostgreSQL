You may want to connect from another machines.
To do that just use the following command 

mysql -h hostname -u username -p

where hostname is the hostname of the remote machines (for postgres you will use 'psql' instead of 'mysql' command)

username is the user that can access to the remote sql server

after pressing enter

you must type the password of that username 

Remember the user must exist in the sql server (if not you must create the user with remote access and 
assign permissions)
