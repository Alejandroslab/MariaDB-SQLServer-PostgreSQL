sudo nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf

change bind-address
from 127.0.0.1
to 0.0.0.0

Doing that it will be possible to accept connections from any device. 
Save and close the config file

Restart the service

sudo systemctl restart mysql

if you have firewall like ufw you have to create a rule for mysql and port 3306

To check the status

systemctl status mysql.service


(In windows just lauch the installer and mysql will be installed as a service (you will have to provide user and password))




Now install MySQL on the client machine. It will install Workbench.
Create New Connection
Provide IP address of Ubuntu Server and leave the default port open (3306) 
or just change that if you have changed the default port

Now just provide the credentials that you have created on ubuntu server for mysql
Click connect

Done!
