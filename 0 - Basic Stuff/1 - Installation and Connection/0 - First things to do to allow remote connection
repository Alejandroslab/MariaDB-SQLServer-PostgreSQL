Remote connection errors are:

'ERROR 2003 (HY000): can't connect...'
or in Dbeaver 'connection refused. socket error'

check this:

Change the file /etc/my.cnf

replace bind address from 127.0.0.0 to 0.0.0.0
save and then restart the mysql server


sudo systemctl restart mysql 

(this either you have mysql or mariadb will work )


check the firewall !
