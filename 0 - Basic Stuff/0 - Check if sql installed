you can use:

which mysql mariadb psql 


this will inspect all the PATH directories looking for mysql then for mariadb and finally for psql (psql is postgres)


or you can use:

whereis mysql mariadb psql

that is a similar command 

if paths will appear this means that the sql services are installed.

anyways they may not be started. check it with:


sudo systemctl  status mysql

(do not use 'service' instead of systemctl as this will not be the standard anymore)
this will check both mysql and mariadb



You may sometime meet this error:

error: 'Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)' -- Missing /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

the error itself means that mysql or mariadb is installed.

this can be fixed just starting the service;

sudo service mysql start
