People who have read and write access are able to perform CRUD operations( create, read, update and delete)
They are the database administrator or engineer

People who have only read access can querying tables 
They are usually data analysts or data scientists


As a data scientist or data analyst you will perform your analysis in python or R and also write SQL queries to pull data from a database 

A good way to approach this data analysis workflow is to connect directly Python or R to a database and write sql queries within python or r

To connect python you will need a database driver that you can install with pip or conda 


For postgresql you can install the driver with

Pip install psycopg2

Then in your python code you will need to import this package and make the connection

For postgresql

import psycopg2
conn = psycopg2.connect(host=‘localhost’, database=‘my_database’, user=‘alex’,password=‘mypassword’)

Where not all arguments are required. If you exclude an argument then the default value will be used.The default host is localhost 

Remember to keep safe your password and be able to share your code you must create another python file with the credentials or just use ssh

Then you can query within python 

cursor= conn.cursor()
cursor.execute(‘SELECT * FROM mytable;’)
result = cursor.fetchall()
print(result)


When you have finished close the connection. As this is a good practice to save resources 


To connect to a database you can also use SQLAlchemy that convert SQL data into python objects 

You can install it with pip
