You will need to install a package to establish a direct connection to your database 

For postgresql 

install.packages(“RPostgres”)
for postgresql then

library(RPostgres)
con<- dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(),
          host=“localhost”,
          dbname=“mydb”,
          user=“paul”
          password=“mypassword”)
          
          
As with python not all arguments are required 

To keep safe the password 
You can encrypt credentials with keyring package 
Or create a config file with the config package
Or setup an environment variable with an .Renviron file
Record the user and pass as a global option with the command options 

The best approach is to prompt the user for a password 

The part of the password will be 
(You have to previously install package “rstudioapi”)

password=rstudioapi::askForPassword(“Password?”), …)



To show all tables in the database

dbListTables(con)

Look at mytable 

dbReadTable(con, “mytable”)

A query 

df<- dbGetQuery(con, “SELECT * FROM mytable”)

When you are done just close the connection

dbDisconnect(con)

print(df)
