You have to alter your table if you want to add a primary key like 'id' etc

you have to set it as PRIMARY, NOT NULL and with AUTO INCREMENT

then, if you want to change the order of the columns you have to do it also with ALTER TABLE

REMEMBER!
after you create a primary key and the set it as not a primary key

if you want the same column the be again your primary key it would be necessary to delete the column and
recreate it. (it gave me a strange error in workbench..)

A foreign key refers to a primary key in another table
