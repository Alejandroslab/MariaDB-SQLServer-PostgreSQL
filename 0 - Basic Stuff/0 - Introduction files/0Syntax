First: always remember to end every line with the semicolon ';'

Second: be carefol to quotes!

this is very insidious:

the quotes always must be single quotes like '' not backticks like ‘ ’

the difference stands in the little inclination towards right of the smart quotes.



then:

remember to use capital letters for commands like (even if it is not needed as SQL requires no special formatting)

SELECT, SHOW, etc


SQL does not care about the number of spaces between terms it will run the code until the semicolon 

This is useful to keep the code readable
