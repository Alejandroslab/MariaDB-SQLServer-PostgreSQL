then extract it and copy the folder to your C:\ drive.

To run it just run 'server.bat'

you can run it also with cmd (and admin privileges)

simply moving to the folder 'bin' and then running:

.\server.bat


The wizard will ask you to assign the password for the root user.

Finally run the console :
You can use the following command to run OrientDB under the console.
With this in mind, go to the same previous path and run the following command:

console.bat


____________________________
REMEMBER! You should download java from the website (java 1.8) and install it
If you have another java like JDK17 it will not work the
"server.bat" file. Therefore if you have multiple java on
your pc try to unistall the ones that you do not need


Once the server is started, go to the web browser and enter the following in the navigation bar: http://localhost:2480. You have to enter the password created for the root user.

After entering the password correctly, you will see the OrientDB graphical interface.

To shutdown the engine, you need to run the following command from the bin folder:

shutdown.bat -p rootpasword

Remember to replace rootpassword with the password you created.

you can also add it to your Environment Variables simply adding a new key called:

ORIENTDB_HOME = C:\orientdb-3.2.1

and then adding to the 'Path' folder your 'bin' folder that is the folder
in which all the executables are located:

C:\orientdb-3.2.1\bin
