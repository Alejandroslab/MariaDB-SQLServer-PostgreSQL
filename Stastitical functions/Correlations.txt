In standard ANSI SQL and PostgreSQL, we calculate the Pearson
correlation coefficient using corr(Y, X). It’s one of several binary aggregate
functions in SQL and is so named because these functions accept two
inputs. In binary aggregate functions, the input Y is the dependent variable
whose variation depends on the value of another variable, and X is the
independent variable whose value doesn’t depend on another variable.

Even though SQL specifies the Y and X inputs for the corr() function,
correlation calculations don’t distinguish between dependent and independent
variables. Switching the order of inputs in corr() produces the same result.
However, for convenience and readability, these examples order the input
variables according to dependent and independent.
