An r-squared value is between zero and one and indicates the
percentage of the variation that is explained by the independent variable.

To find r-squared, we use the regr_r2(Y, X) function in SQL.

SELECT round(
regr_r2(median_hh_income, pct_bachelors_higher)::numeric, 3
) AS r_squared
FROM acs_2011_2015_stats;

The r-squared value of 0.465 indicates that about 47 percent of the
variation in median household income in a county can be explained by
the percentage of people with a bachelorâ€™s degree or higher in that
county. What explains the other 53 percent of the variation in household
income? Any number of factors could explain the rest of the variation,
and statisticians will typically test numerous combinations of variables to
determine what they are.
