In Workbench you can also import a csv to a table that you will create on the fly
in the Navigator Panel under the Schemas tab:
Just right click on your Tables tab and select 'Table Data Import Wizard'
follow the instructions, select your csv and then click on import!

done!

remember that you should create your primary key afterwards as in the wizard it seems not possibile to create
the primary key

to do that right click on your table in the Navigator Panel under the Schemas tab and select
'Alter Table'
with alter table you will be able to edit the structure
