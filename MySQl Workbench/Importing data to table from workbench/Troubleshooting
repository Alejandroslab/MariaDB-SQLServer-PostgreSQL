Troubleshooting loading a csv:

The programm will automatically detect the correct delimiter therefore there is no need to adjust the delimiter

when you import the data you can have the preview of the table and if you click
on the configuration icon you can also set your delimiter



Now sometimes problems can arise with the primary key

the primary key usually the 'ID' must have the 'AI' option flagged!

the AI option stands for 'Auto Increment'. THis means that the primary key will automatically Increment
at each new record

you should also check the length of the eventual VARCHAR()

set it as 'VARCHAR(255)'
where 255 stands for the characters length
