First you have to set a 'Default Schema' that is a default database

then you have to open a new Query File and select your table


select * from PTITA;

In Workbench you don't have also to remember to put the symbol ';'
as the command will work anyways

you can run your code simply pressing 'ctrl + enter'

you will see now your table


Remember that you must always create a table before importing it
and it must have the same size in terms of columns

Anyways the csv file could also not have the 'ID' column
as this will be created automatically by Workbench


Click on 'Import records from an external file'

then browse to your csv file
click on Next
then select 'Use existing table' and leave it the name like 'Database.Table'
click on Next

now check the columns of your csv that should correspond to the ones of your table
done!

click on next and wait your table to populate

now if you click on the symbol of 'Refresh'
you will see your table
