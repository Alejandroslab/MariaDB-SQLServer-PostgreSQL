Microsft products like PowerBI, Excel, etc when talking about 'SQL Server' connection
refer to the Microsoft SQL Server that is a product by Microsoft

This kind of product can be installed only on Ubuntu


To connect to the MySQL Server (the MySQL one and not
the microsoft branded sql software)
you have to use PowerBI and select 'MySQL Connection'
in Excel you cannot connect to a MySQL server unless if you previously don't set up and ODBC connection


It's a bit confusing..
