MySQL is not supported in Excel by default

In order to use it you have to previously setup an ODBC connection

First download and install MySQL installer in your machine

Rememeber to select 'Connector ODBC 8.0'

(REMEMBER: as of August 2021 Importing in Excel with the Connector ODBC version 8.0.2.6 gets DataSource.Error: ODBC: ERROR [42000]
the solution is to downgrade to the version 8.0.2.5)

Select the x64 Version as your Excel will be probably a 64 bit version
(to check it open Excel File->Account->About Excel)

Remember to install the 8.0 version and not the 5.3 (legacy version)

Install it.

Now in Windows we have to setup the ODBC connection

In start type 'ODBC Data Sources'. Select the 64 bit version as you have installed the 64 bit mysql connector

Now click on 'System DSN' tab to create a connection that is valid for all users.

Click on 'Add' then select 'MySQL ODBC 8.0 Unicode Driver'
(If you do not find it you have opened the ODBC Data Sources 32bit. Open the 64 bit version.)

Click on 'Finish'

Now the MySQL Connector will open.

In 'Data Source Name' type the label of the Connection

You can leave 'Description' empty
In 'TCP/IP Server' you have to type in the hostname of your mysql server
Leave the default port that for mysql is always 3306

Now type the User and Password of your mysql server
You do not have to select a Database (you can leave it empty)
The last thing to do is click on details and check 'Allow big result sets'

You can click on 'Test'. If appears 'Connection Successful' all done. It works

Click Ok! DONE

Now click ok on 'ODBC Data Sources'

Now open Excel

Go to Data tab

'Get Data'->'From Other Sources'->'From ODBC'
Select now from the drop down menu the DSN that you have just created

Click OK

You will see the list of all your databases
You can browse your databases and select your tables

If you click on load excel will open the table in a new sheet

DONE!
you have successfully created the connection to you MySQL server
