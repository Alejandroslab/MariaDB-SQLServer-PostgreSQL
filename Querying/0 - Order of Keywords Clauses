SELECT columns to display 
FROM table or tables
WHERE filtering rows
GROUP BY split rows in groups
HAVING filter grouped rows
ORDER BY columns to sort 

Only select and from are required. 

Remember the order with a sentence 

Start
Friday
With
Grandma
Homemade
Oatmeal

Anyways the order of execution is different 
First sql gather all data with FROM
Filters rows with WHERE
groups rows with the GROUP BY
Filters grouped rows with HAVING 
Only now specifies columns with SELECT
Rearranges results with the ORDER BY

LIMIT clause is only supported by MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite


Other way to see clauses

SELECT Last_Name, First_Name, Description,
Wage - (SELECT AVG(Wage) FROM Employees)
FROM Employees, Departments
WHERE Department = Code AND
Wage > (SELECT AVG (Wage)
        FROM Employees);
