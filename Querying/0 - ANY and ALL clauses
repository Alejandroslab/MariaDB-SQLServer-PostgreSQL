SELECT columns to display (columns can be also the result of the funciont and MUST BE SEPARATED by comma)
FROM tables or tables
JOIN
WHERE conditions on rows (filtering rows)
GROUP BY split rows in groups
  HAVING conditions on groups (filter grouped rows)
ORDER BY order on the indicated columns listed with the select clause (columns to sort)
LIMIT



the mandatories are just SELECT and FROM
the other ones are facultative



Remember the order with a sentence

Start
Friday
Joy
With
Grandma
Homemade
Oatmeal

Anyways the order of execution is different
First sql gather all data with FROM
Filters rows with WHERE
groups rows with the GROUP BY
Filters grouped rows with HAVING
Only now specifies columns with SELECT
Rearranges results with the ORDER BY

LIMIT clause is only supported by MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite

EXAMPLES

Other way to see clauses

SELECT Last_Name, First_Name, Description,
Wage - (SELECT AVG(Wage) FROM Employees)
FROM Employees, Departments
WHERE Department = Code AND
Wage > (SELECT AVG (Wage)
        FROM Employees);



SELECT Last_Name, First_Name, Description,
      Wage - (SELECT AVG(Wage) FROM Employees)

FROM Employees, Departments
JOIN Employees ON
     d.Code = e.Department;

WHERE Department = Code AND
Wage > (SELECT AVG (Wage)
        FROM Employees);

        NNER JOIN Employees ON
             Departments.Code = Employees.Department;
