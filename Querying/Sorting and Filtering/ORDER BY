If you want to sort you use ORDER BY
the direction is always ascendent and you have to specify DESC if you want the contrary

ORDER BY should be put as last statement of the command:

SELECT LAST_NAME, FIRST_NAME, City
FROM Employees
ORDER BY LAST_NAME, FIRST_NAME;

You can nest it:

SELECT LAST_NAME, Wage
FROM Employees
ORDER BY Wage DESC, LAST_NAME;

this will allow to order in descending order by the wage level
when the wage are the same it will order by LAST_NAME.

you can also use the number for the field

SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice, Quantity, UnitPrice*Quantity
FROM Invoice
ORDER BY 4 DESC;

where 4 indicate the fourth field (the last one that is UnitPrice*Quantity)
