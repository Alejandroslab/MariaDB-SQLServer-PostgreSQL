You can also use 'HAVING' with group by

SELECT Department, COUNT (ID), SUM(Wage),
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
HAVING COUNT(ID)>2;

if the select query has the where clause, the values will be grouped after operating
the selection of the rows that respects the written conditions near 'where'

having has similar characteristics than 'where' but it
acts in a different way: with 'where' some conditions vinculate on
the tbale rows, with 'having' the control of the condition is made on the result
of the aggregate functions applied to group of rows

to sum up:
'HAVING' gets some conditions on the groups
'WHERE' get conditions on single rows.
