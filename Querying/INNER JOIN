Select Employees.*, Departments.*
FROM Departments INNER JOIN Employees ON
     Departments.Code = Employees.Department;

Structured query:

SELECT LAST_NAME, FIRST_NAME, Description
FROM Employees, Departments
WHERE Department=Code AND City = 'London';

Department=Code is necessary to specify the common attributes of the tables

it is more clear if you specify all the name of the tables:

SELECT Employees.LAST_NAME, Employees.FIRST_NAME, Departments.Description
FROM Employees, Departments
WHERE Employess.Department=Departmens.Code AND Departmens.City = 'London';


you can add an alias in order to shorten the query like this:

SELECT E.LAST_NAME, E.FIRST_NAME, D.Description
FROM Employees AS I INNER JOIN Departments AS D ON
E.Department = D.Code
WHERE D.City =  'London';
