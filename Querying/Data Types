char(n)

it is better to use always char(n) where n is the number of char
Doing this will allow to anyone to easily understand which kind of data have been saved in your db.
anyways varchar(n) is yet used as a standard too

Use integer when possible unless you use decimal
floating-point types will save space but sometimes will lead to numerical mistakes
