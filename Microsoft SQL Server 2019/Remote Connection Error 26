In my case I have installed SQL Server on a Windows Server 2019 Machine

Therefore I want to connect to that machine from another one

If you try to connect without setting up you may incur in Error 26

To fix this:

To do that you have to configure the Windows Server 2019 Firewall
because otherwise you will not be able to connect successfully

Plus you may want to set a static IP for your client machine
as you will have to indicate the IP's allowed.


To configure the Firewall you will need to setup a new rule

go to:

Windows Administrative Tools then choose Windows Firewall with Advanced Security

Under Windows Firewall with Advanced Security on Local Computer column, click on the Inbound Rule and then select New Rule from the right Panel

From New Inbound Rule Wizard window, select Custom and then click on the Next button

Under Does this rule apply to all programs or a specific program? select All programs then click on Next button

Form Protocol type list, select Any and then click on Next button

Under Which remote OP addresses does this rule apply to? select These IP addresses and then click on Add button

In IP Address dialog box, under This IP address or subnet type the IP address and then click on Ok button

Under What action should be taken when a connection matches the specified conditions? select Allow the connection and then click on Next button

Click on the Next button to complete the New Outbound Rule Wizard steps

DONE!

Another thing to check to fix error 26:

open SQL Server Management Studio, Right click on the database and select properties
On Security page, select SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode and click on Ok button
Restart SQL Server



If you are still facing the SQL Server Error 26,
then there could be a same name conflict between two systems.
Check whether the computer name, system name is same if yes,
then try to system using its IP address.
