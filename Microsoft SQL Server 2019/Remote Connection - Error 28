If you have managed to solve the Error 26
now you may incur in the Error 28 - Server doesn't support requested protocol

This error exist because SQL Server has network protocols disabled by Default

To enable them open 'Sql server Configuration Manager'
select SQL Server Network Configuration and then
and turn on "Named Pipes" and "TCP/IP"

 After that, you need to restart the SQL Server Browser and SQL Server(instance) services.

 DONE!

 Now you can connect from your client machine
