when you create a login user you can set permission to it
In MSSMS under 'Databases' 'Security' 'Logins' select the user that you have created (to create one click right on the 'Logins' folder)

then double click on the user

You may want to change permissions under 'Securables' and also under 'User mapping'


With user mapping you can assign the user to be the dbowner of a particular table
(just flag the 'dbowner')

In particular I have solved some problems using 'User mapping' as it was not possible to assign permissions differently in a data migration from a mysql instance to sqlserver
