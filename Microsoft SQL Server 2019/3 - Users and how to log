Logging to your SQL Server instance is easily
You can log with Windows Authentication or SQL Server Authentication

The first one allows to login with the LOCAL windows Account
this means that all the local windows account can connect with their credentials

Local means only on the same machine in which you have installed SQL server

if you want to connect remotely you cannot use Windows Authentication
as if you try you will get Error 18456 'login failed'

In this case you have to use SQL Server Authentication


To use the latter you should create a user first
