In the machine in which you have installed your SQL Server Instance
You can download also the GUI that will allow you to interact with it

This is called 'Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio ' (abbreviated as SSMS)

Just download it for free from Microsoft official website, install it
and restart your system

Once you open it you can choose 'Windows Authentication' or 'SQL Server Authentication'
with the 'SQL Server Authentication' you have to remember the password
that you have set up for the 'sa' user (aka standard user)
during the installation of the SQL Server

if you don't remember it just go with Windows Authentication
that means that you will connect with your Windows credentials

Click on connect and done!

Now you are ready to write you sql scripts.

Remmeber that you can manage you SQL Server
event with HeidiSQL
